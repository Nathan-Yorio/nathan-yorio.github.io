    <p>I recently became aware of a plugin for <a href="">Obsidian</a> which allows one to generate static web pages from the content of an Obsidian vault.
The plugin is called <a href="https://github.com/KosmosisDire/obsidian-webpage-export">Webpage HTML Export</a> and it is still in active development, but it begins to
fill the gap that Obsidian Publish does not fill for those who wish to host the content themselves.</p>
<p>I then thought that perhaps I could integrate these static pages into my static Hugo site and I wanted to document how that process was for me. Being able to
integrate these pages would be incredibly convenient as I store all of my notes in Obsidian and having the ability to translate the visibility of those
notes directly into a webpage that I host would make it a lot easier to share the things that I write with others without necessarily needing to make a
formal post on this Hugo site.</p>
